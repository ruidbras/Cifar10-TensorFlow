# CIFAR-10 Classification with Keras

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60 000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6 000 images per class.<br>
To get more info on this dataset check the tech report [Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf), Alex Krizhevsky, 2009.<br>

This repo contains the implementation of a deep learning model on CIFAR-10 dataset using Keras framework with Tensorflow backend.
